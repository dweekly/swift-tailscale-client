> Unofficial Swift 6 client for the Tailscale LocalAPI

`swift-tailscale-client` is a personal, MIT-licensed project by David E. Weekly. It is **not** an official Tailscale product and is not endorsed by Tailscale Inc. The goal is to provide an idiomatic async/await Swift interface to the LocalAPI so Apple-platform apps can query Tailscale state without shelling out to the `tailscale` CLI.

## What This Package Does

This package **connects to an existing tailscaled daemon** to query its state and configuration. It's designed for building monitoring tools, status widgets, dashboards, and developer utilities that work with an existing Tailscale installation.

**This is NOT an embedded Tailscale implementation.** If you need to embed Tailscale directly into your application (making your app its own tailnet node), see Tailscale's official [TailscaleKit](https://github.com/tailscale/libtailscale/tree/main/swift) instead.

### Use swift-tailscale-client when you want to:
- Build a menu bar app, widget, or dashboard showing Tailscale status
- Query peer information, connection state, exit nodes from Swift
- Monitor tailscaled without embedding the full Tailscale implementation
- Create developer tools that inspect or modify Tailscale configuration
- Integrate Tailscale status into existing apps (lightweight, pure Swift)

### Use TailscaleKit when you want to:
- Create a standalone service that joins a tailnet without installing Tailscale system-wide
- Build an app that acts as its own independent Tailscale node
- Distribute an application that includes Tailscale functionality
- Have multiple services with different Tailscale identities on the same device

## Status
- **v0.1.0 (in progress):** Provides a `TailscaleClient.status()` API that fetches `/localapi/v0/status` and decodes the response into strongly typed Swift models.
- Future roadmap items (whois, preferences, streaming IPN bus, etc.) are tracked in [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md).

## Installation
Add the package to your `Package.swift` dependencies (once published):

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/dweekly/swift-tailscale-client.git", from: "0.1.0")
```

## Quickstart
```swift
import TailscaleClient

let client = TailscaleClient()
let status = try await client.status()
print(status.selfNode?.hostName ?? "unknown")
```

### Configuration Overrides
### macOS LocalAPI Discovery
On macOS the client automatically discovers the App Store GUI's loopback LocalAPI using a two-tier approach:
1. **lsof probe** (~140ms): Inspects open files of `IPNExtension`/`Tailscale` processes to find the `sameuserproof-<port>-<token>` file
2. **Filesystem fallback** (~2s): Enumerates `~/Library/Group Containers/...` directories when lsof is unavailable

This ensures the client works without additional configuration in most scenarios.

Useful environment variables:

| Environment variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `TAILSCALE_DISCOVERY_DEBUG` | Set to `1` to log discovery decisions (pids scanned, directories searched, selected port/token prefix). |
| `TAILSCALE_SAMEUSER_PATH` | Override with an explicit path to a `sameuserproof-*` file. |
| `TAILSCALE_SAMEUSER_DIR` | Restrict filesystem fallback scanning to a specific directory. |
| `TAILSCALE_SKIP_LSOF` | Set to `1` to disable the `lsof` probe and use filesystem scanning only. |

`TailscaleClient` discovers how to talk to the LocalAPI using environment variables. These are handy when running in CI or when the default Unix socket path is unavailable.

| Environment variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `TAILSCALE_LOCALAPI_SOCKET` | Override the Unix domain socket path (defaults to `/var/run/tailscale/tailscaled.sock`). |
| `TAILSCALE_LOCALAPI_PORT` / `TAILSCALE_LOCALAPI_HOST` | Connect via loopback TCP (requires `TAILSCALE_LOCALAPI_AUTHKEY`). |
| `TAILSCALE_LOCALAPI_URL` | Provide a full base URL (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:41112`). |
| `TAILSCALE_LOCALAPI_AUTHKEY` | Basic-auth token used when connecting over TCP. |
| `TAILSCALE_LOCALAPI_CAPABILITY` | Custom capability version to advertise (defaults to `1`). |

## Testing
- Unit tests rely on mock transports and sanitized JSON fixtures; run with `swift test`.
- Integration tests that talk to a real tailscaled instance are opt-in. Ensure Tailscale is running locally, then execute:
  ```bash
  TAILSCALE_INTEGRATION=1 swift test --filter TailscaleClientIntegrationTests
  ```
  You can also override socket or loopback settings using the environment variables above.
- GitHub Actions will execute only the mock-backed suites to keep CI hermetic.
