# Security Policy

`swift-tailscale-client` is an unofficial personal project by David E. Weekly and is not affiliated with Tailscale Inc. Security-sensitive reports are still appreciated so issues can be fixed quickly for the community.

## Supported Versions
Until v1.0.0 is released, the latest published version is the only supported release. Security fixes will be issued as patch releases on top of the most recent minor version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please email security reports to [dweekly@networkweather.com](mailto:dweekly@networkweather.com). Include:
- Description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce.
- Potential impact.
- Any suggested mitigations.

You will receive a response within 5 business days. Once a fix is available, we aim to disclose the issue within 14 days unless a longer embargo is mutually agreed upon.

Because this is an unofficial project, do not contact Tailscale Inc. about vulnerabilities in this codebase.
